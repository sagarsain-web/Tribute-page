          <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of sardar Vallabhbhai Patel life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel[1][2][needs Gujarati IPA] (31 October 1875 – 15 December 1950),
               popularly known as Sardar Patel, was an Indian politician. He served as the first Deputy Prime 
               Minister of India. He was an Indian barrister, and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress
                who played a leading role in the country's struggle for independence and guided its
                 integration into a united, independent nation.[3] In India and elsewhere, he was often
                  called Sardar, meaning "chief" in Hindi, Urdu, and Persian
                . He acted as Home Minister during the political integration of India and the
                 Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.[4]</li>
            <li>
              At the urging of his friends, Patel ran in the election for the post of sanitation
               commissioner of Ahmedabad in 1917 and won. While often clashing with British
                officials on civic issues, he did not show any interest in politics. Upon hearing 
                of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, he joked to the lawyer and political activist,
                 Ganesh Vasudev Mavlankar, that "Gandhi would ask you if you know how to sift
                  pebbles from wheat. And that is supposed to bring independence." A subsequent meeting with
               Gandhi, in October 1917 fundamentally changed Patel and led him to join the Indian
               independence struggle.[21]

              Patel took charge of the integration of the princely states into
               India.[54] This achievement formed the cornerstone of Patel's
                popularity in the post-independence era.
